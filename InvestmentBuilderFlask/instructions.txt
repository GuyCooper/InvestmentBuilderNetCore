Python steps for creating a project:

1. create a virtual environment.  this is required so you can rub different versions of python packages in different environments. A new environemnt
should be created for each project or project group.

a: open cmd prompt. create project folder. cd into project folder.
b: run: python3 -m venv venv. This will create a subfolder in project folder called venv. 
c: activate virtual env: from command line :\venv\scripts\activate/bat. command line will change to (venv) :\
d: running python from command line will invoke it in the virtual environemnt.

you will have to activate the environment each time you open a new command prompt.

to run flask (web server) you need to set the following env variable to the top level .py file of your project to run it:

:\ set FLASK_APP=testapp.py

and then run:

:\flask run

updating the database schema:

flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
